## Day 1

[cool intro activity](https://github.com/kschaffer/dplintros)

### Representation

[domains modules, we specifically used the representation one](https://umw.domains/modules)

Input + Content --> Algo (black box) --> Output

What is the output? 

Representation:
 - Unconscious bias
   - developers
   - users
   - other users

Older conceptions <--> Stereotypes

**Engagement is easy to count and measure. So it is often used to measure the success of the algorithm.**

Without a check in the code, the algorithm's version of reality will radicalize beyond the hard-coded reality and the stereotype because of the loop.

If you click things that you feel are more just you can positively impact this loop.

Checks in the code could be what text is extracted around the image to improve results.

#### How do we hack/influence the model?
  - media creation
  - open content
  - reporting on the platform (sorta works, but moderators lack context)
  - Activism - public pressure, legislative pressure
  - educate 
  - deliberate consumption
  - self-examination

## Day 2

[Kumu](https://kumu.io) for mapping

Mapping activity about data, what does your  bank know about you? (ex: Phone, Income, SSN) and what other companies know this stuff

DatDA
  - legal action (if you have the resources)
  - legislative pressure
  - educate
  - gather info (Terms of Service, Privacy policies), use something like [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/)
  - OS
  - browser
  - public pressure
    - on lawmakers
    - on companies
  - data cleanups
  - pw managers
  - diff emails, or + email addresses (myemail@gmail.com myemail+bestbuy@gmail.com), or adding periods in gmail addresses
  - separation of accounts or maybe devices
  - VPN or TOR, use a reputable VPN service that costs money
  - deleting apps

Trust Compression (from [@holden](https://twitter.com/holden))

We tend to lump together the 50% trustworthy things with things near the bottom of the scale

DigDetox
 - how many apps on your phone? 166
 - how many have you used in the last 7 days? 73 44%
 - how many apps do you know how they use your data? 
 
Privacy vs. Secret
 - root of privacy is privy, who do you tell things?
